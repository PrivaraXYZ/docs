# Privara

**The Consumer App for Programmable Stablecoins**

Built on ReineiraOS. Web3 infrastructure. Web2 experience.

---

## Overview

Privara is the consumer application layer for ReineiraOS. It delivers a familiar payments experience — while the protocol handles confidentiality, escrow, and cross-chain operations underneath.

No seed phrases. No gas fees. No bridging. Stablecoins accessible to everyone.

## The Problem

Stablecoins offer real advantages: instant global transfers, 24/7 availability, low fees. But the user experience limits mainstream adoption:

- **Wallet complexity** — Seed phrases, private keys, recovery flows
- **Gas fees** — Unpredictable costs for every transaction
- **Bridging friction** — Moving funds between chains is confusing and risky
- **No privacy** — All balances and transactions visible on-chain

The infrastructure has matured. Privacy and escrow are now possible on-chain. But these capabilities remain locked behind developer tools and complex interfaces.

## The Solution

Privara wraps ReineiraOS capabilities in a simple, familiar interface.

| ReineiraOS Layer | Privara Experience |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Reineira Stablecoin (FHE) | Private balances users can see, others can't |
| Escrow Engine | "Hold until delivery" in one tap |
| Cross-chain Deposits | Fund from any chain, no bridging UI |

---

## How It Works

### Virtual Accounts

Users don't manage wallets. Privara creates a virtual account layer with smart accounts underneath.

- No seed phrases — social login, biometrics, or passkeys
- One identity across chains
- Recovery built-in — no risk of lost funds from lost keys

### Seamless Transactions

Send, receive, and hold confidential stablecoins without friction.

- Gas abstracted — users never see or pay gas fees directly
- Bridges hidden — cross-chain deposits route automatically
- Instant settlement

### Escrow Payments

Hold funds conditionally with a simple interface.

- Escrow in one tap — funds held until conditions met
- Time-based, signature-based, or oracle-based release
- DVP support for tokenized asset trades

### Multi-chain Deposits

Fund your Privara account from multiple chains.

- Use existing wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.)
- Auto-routing to Reineira stablecoin
- Settled confidentially on Arbitrum
- No manual bridging required

## Conclusion

Privara bridges the gap between powerful stablecoin infrastructure and the simplicity users expect.
